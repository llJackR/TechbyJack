        <h2>These are the reasons that make dogs better:</h2>

        <p><h3>Have you ever wanted a bigger or smaller cat? well to bad only dogs come in sizes bigger and smaller. Cats cannot be taken outside unless they live outside. If you want a cat you have to have a litter box but for dogs you can simply let them outside and they can pee without having a liter box. Dogs also are more domesticated then cat since cats are like little tigers running around in your house where dogs are love machienes that love you. Thats why I think you should get a dog.</h3></p>
